# Unreal Tournament Engine Reimplementation

The goal of this project is to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to make the original Unreal Tournament maps playable.

Maybe it will use UnrealScript for the game code. Maybe it will only end up using some custom C++ code for a mini instagib game. Maybe it will stay as only as a map viewer. Only time will tell! :)
