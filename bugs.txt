- Gibbing on certain maps in Debug mode causes out of bounds vertex access
- "Step adjust" seems too aggressive, walking off an edge causes a significant drop downward (at lethal heights, falling eventually occurs)
- There's a memory leak (might have to do with some actors not disappearing? unsure, need a longer test run)
- Teleporters are fuckin weird sometimes
- Respawning in the ground?
- swimming physics not implemented
- PHYS_Swimming persists after dying in WaterZone
	- might be because water physics isn't implemented
- Starting match in Tournament crashes with null object dereference
- font rendering is a bit broken
- where are the scripted textures?
- ughhh......water textures ;-;
- decals don't clip to bsp correctly
- decals don't appear at all sometimes
- rendering seeds crashes the game
- viewclass crashes with null deref
- lightmap rendering is kind of off
- In DM-Deck16][, it is possible to pick up the shield belt by walking on the bridge above the actual pickup
- Bots literally rotate their entire body (feet off the ground) to look up/downin ways they shouldn't be able to
	- i think its reproducible by jumping on top of a bot?
