- Guns don't drop (check physics type, probably unimplemented)
- Gibs bounce offset upwards from the ground (bad collision?)
	- all actors, if allowed to fall, land elevated from the ground
- Collision cylinders aren't being respected
	- is ActorSphereIntersect in TraceCylinderLevel::Trace actually correct? really need to visualize this math to see what's happening
	- might be the cause of getting snagged on level geometry, projectiles blowing up immediately, gibs bouncing offset from the ground
- (Ripper projectile) Razor2.SetRoll is just disappearing from the class?
	- maybe it tries to execute SetRoll after state Flying?
- Gibbing on certain maps in Debug mode causes out of bounds vertex access
- "Step adjust" seems too aggressive, walking off an edge causes a significant drop downward (at lethal heights, falling eventually occurs)
- There's some weird forward acceleration happening when you jump forward in the air
- There's a memory leak (might have to do with some actors not disappearing? unsure, need a longer test run)
- Teleporters are fuckin weird sometimes
- Respawning in the ground?
- AnimEnd is broken
	- Rocket Launcher idle animation loops incorrectly
	- bio rifle alt fire loops incorrectly
	- bullet impact doesn't disappear
	- Shock Rifle fire animation plays one additional time
- UMenu background is not scaled correctly?
- PHYS_Swimming persists after dying in WaterZone
- Starting match in Tournament crashes with null object dereference
- switchlevel is fucked
- flak shards not colliding with bots
- font rendering is a bit broken
- where are the scripted textures?
- ughhh......water textures ;-;
- flying and swimming physics not implemented
