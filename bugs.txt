- Guns don't drop (check physics type, probably unimplemented)
- Gibs bounce offset upwards from the ground (bad collision?)
	- all actors, if allowed to fall, land elevated from the ground         
- Gibbing on certain maps in Debug mode causes out of bounds vertex access
- "Step adjust" seems too aggressive, walking off an edge causes a significant drop downward (at lethal heights, falling eventually occurs)
	- pawn/bsp collision needs to be sorted out first
- There's a memory leak (might have to do with some actors not disappearing? unsure, need a longer test run)
- Teleporters are fuckin weird sometimes
- Respawning in the ground?
- UMenu background is not scaled correctly?
- swimming physics not implemented
- PHYS_Swimming persists after dying in WaterZone
	- might be because water physics isn't implemented
- Starting match in Tournament crashes with null object dereference
- font rendering is a bit broken
- where are the scripted textures?
- ughhh......water textures ;-;
- decals don't clip to bsp correctly
- decals don't appear at all sometimes
- rendering seeds crashes the game
- viewclass crashes with null deref

- movement stuff
	- zonegroundvelocity = 0 -> velocity never slows (except for slopes)
	- zoneterminalvelocity = 0 -> falling velocity capped at 0
